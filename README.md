## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Cubed square, and this is my Github page
Expect random projects, strange programming solutions, and generally robust yet overly complicated code.
I have a youtube channel by the same name with some videos on it, but it's currently discontinued.
My code is fine to distribute as long as credit is given, and remixing is encouraged to find new solutions to past problems.
I haven't used Github until now, so expect missing details :P
I program in primarily Python, but some CSS, Javascript, and HTML
Cheers!
